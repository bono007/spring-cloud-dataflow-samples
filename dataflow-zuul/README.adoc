= Data Flow Zuul Proxy Example

This example provides an example of using the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server behind
a Zuul proxy server.

The Zuul proxy server will start on port `8080`. When you go to
`http://localhost:8080/dashboard` you will see that all Dashboard requests will be
proxied over to port `9393`.

Please make sure that you start Spring Cloud Data Flow Server with the property
`server.use-forward-headers` and the value `true`.

In order to get everything running we need to setup the following server instances:

* Spring Cloud Skipper (port `7577`)
* Spring Cloud Data Flow (port `9393`)

== Build + Run

Build the sample using `$ mvn clean package` and run using
`$ java -jar target/dataflow-zuul-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
